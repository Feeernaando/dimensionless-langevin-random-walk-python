# General info
The following code performs a random walk using the dimensionless version of the Lagevin equation. A pdf with the respective equations can be found under the name Equation.pdf within this repository. 

# Libraries used
The programme uses the followign python libraries

* scipy                    
* math 
* numpy
* datetime                                                     
* time                           
* random
* matplotlib.pyplot as plt    

# Setup
To compile and execute the code python3 is necessary 

* In Linux (Ubunut) the code is compiled and executed by typing in terminal

python3 ./Langevin_Random_Walk_Dimensionless.py

* To use the code create and specific folder. In such folder compile the code and save the files to be used to create the histogram.

# Test datafile
In order for the user to give it a try along side this programme you can find a random walk file named 'Random_Walk.txt' where a random walk has been stored.

I also provide a short script for gnuplot in order to visualize such random walk. The file is 'Plot_Rndm_Walk.plt'
